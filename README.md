## create of a Virtual Machine to host a wordpress site, using mariaDB, wordpress(obviously), lighttpd(webserver) and php(needed by wordpress) and put some other features like, strong password policys, the monitoring.sh running each 10 minutes, between others.

### unfortunately it`s a kinda difficult make an upload of 30gb`s Virtual machine to github, so here you only will find the monitoring script :(
